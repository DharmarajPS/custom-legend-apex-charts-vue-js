Basically Apex charts supports inbuilt legend and also custom legend. But if you use custom legend, click/hover events of the legend will stop working if you provide these custom legend labels. 

Now I have created custom code to add click/hover events for custom legend in vue js.

Our ultimate goal is to achieve legend hover/click events as like apex charts default hover/click event.

Advantage

1. You can replace legend marker style with your own style
2. If your chart's legend items are more then you can modify with this custom code and can apply slider to your legend at your wish
